# CSS units
CSS has several different units for expressing a length. Many CSS properties take "length" values, such as width, margin, padding, font-size, etc.

Length is a number followed by a length unit, such as 10px, 2em, etc.
There are two types of length units: absolute and relative.

## Absolute
The absolute length units are fixed and a length expressed in any of these will appear as exactly that size.

Units which are absolute in size are: `px`


## Relative
Relative length units specify a length relative to another length property. Relative length units scale better between different rendering medium.

Relative units are: `em`, `rem`

`em`--> Relative to the font-size of the element (2em means 2 times the size of the current font).

`rem` --> Relative to font-size of the root element.

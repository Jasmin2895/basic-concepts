It informs the web browser about the type and version of HTML used in building the web document. This helps to handle and load it properly. The **DTD** (Document type definition) had to contain reference to their document type.

## What kind of things must you be wary of when design or developing for multilingual sites?
 Things to consider when building sites for multilingual sites can be the following:
 * **Machine Translation** -  The first problem that designers and developers encounter are text translation. Sometimes client expect them to provide multi lingual support without putting in extra costs. In this case the easy solution to go for is Google Translate, it becomes difficult to validate the translation whether it is good or bad. Although, machine translations can produce some good results but the cases where a majority of cases where a sensitive information and culture awareness is needed, it can do little to nothing. An experienced translator
 
 * **Language options misplacement** - If the visitors come to your website they will look for a button with translate option, if they are unable to find the button they will instantly leave. To make the user experience better you can use icons such as flags to define different country language or you can place LTR button at the right top corner to solve the problem.

* **No Culture Awareness** - When two people from different cultures meet, they need to learn one another’s customs. In terms of design, this means adapting all the design elements to the needs of the target culture. But how not to offend someone from a different culture?
The right answer to this question is to research. Find out what the customs of the country are and try to go with neutral principles. For example, in the west it is normal for people to use images of women in T-shirts and with hair flowing around.

* **Content organization** - Organization of content on your multilingual website is one of the most important elements in web design. It largely depends on the writing system, i.e. direction. For example, if you come from an English or Spanish-speaking country, where people read and write from left to right (LTR).

* **Encoding and special characters** - Similarly to writing direction, a website’s language can be written in different scripts with special characters (such as č, ć, ž, đ, š for Slavic languages which use the Latin alphabet, or Cyrillic alphabet which is used in Russian, Bulgarian, Serbian and Azerbaijan websites) which demand the use of special encoding and fonts which support them.

* **Duplicate Content** - Duplicate content is an SEO issue and Google will punish you for having it on your website. Duplicate content issues occur when someone forgets to translate all the web page elements and content, so they remain written in the source language, which Google sees as duplicate content and then penalizes your page for it. solve this problem, your developer or SEO specialist should identify a preferred language variety for each location and/or language. So, for example, if you have the same content for Australian, Canadian and British websites, your developer should assign a <link rel=”alternate” href=”example.com” hreflang=”en-uk” /> or en-au or en-nz alternatives for each location.

* **Dates and orthography** - Dates and orthography are important because they vary across the world. For example, if you schedule a promotion on April 1, 2018 – this date will look differently in Europe and in the USA. The French write their dates in the following format: day/month/year, whereas the Americans switch month and day: month/day/year. 
To avoid this, learn or Google what date formats and other orthographic principles apply for your target country and use them consistently throughout the website to avoid confusion.

* **No word for SEO** - When web design and development are done, an SEO expert should adapt your website to the rules of the biggest algorithm on the planet. If you fail to do local SEO on your multilingual website, the results will never come.  It is best to hire an **SEO agency** or an expert to go through your website code in every language you have on your website and adjust it to the rules of the local search engine.
